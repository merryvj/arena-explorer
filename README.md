When I use Are.na to collect ideas and other fragments, I want to organize ideas in relation to each other. This project is a baby step in trying to build tooling to support my personal wanderings on the web. 

 
### Features
* Import blocks from any public channel using the channel URL
* Reposition and expand/minimize blocks
* View embedded videos and websites in context
