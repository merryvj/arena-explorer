An item is listed in the CATALOG if it is deemed:\n\n-   Useful as a tool,\n-   Relevant to independent education,\n-   High quality or low cost,\n-   Not already common knowledge,\n-   Easily available by mail.\n\nCATALOG listings are continually revised according to the experience and suggestions of CATALOG users and staff.\n\n*Purpose* (emphasis mine)  \n **We are as gods and might as well get good at it.** So far, remotely done power and glory—as via government, big business, formal education, church—has succeeded to the point where gross defects obscure actual gains. In response to this dilemma and to these gains a realm of intimate, personal power is developing—**power of the individual to conduct his own education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment**, and share his adventure with whoever is interested. Tools that aid this process are sought and promoted by the WHOLE EARTH CATALOG.","source":{"url":"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6f/Wh-earth-69-cover.jpg/435px-Wh-earth-69-cover.jpg","title":null,"provider":{"name":"http://upload.wikimedia.org","url":"http://upload.wikimedia.org"}},"image":{"filename":"435px-Wh-earth-69-cover.jpg","content_type":"image/jpeg","updated_at":"2011-07-26T16:35:00.511Z","thumb":{"url":"https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiI2MzYvb3JpZ2luYWxfNDM1cHgtV2gtZWFydGgtNjktY292ZXIuanBnIiwiZWRpdHMiOnsicmVzaXplIjp7IndpZHRoIjo0MDAsImhlaWdodCI6NDAwLCJmaXQiOiJpbnNpZGUiLCJ3aXRob3V0RW5sYXJnZW1lbnQiOnRydWV9LCJ3ZWJwIjp7InF1YWxpdHkiOjkwfSwianBlZyI6eyJxdWFsaXR5Ijo5MH0sInJvdGF0ZSI6bnVsbH19?bc=1"},"square":{"url":"https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiI2MzYvb3JpZ2luYWxfNDM1cHgtV2gtZWFydGgtNjktY292ZXIuanBnIiwiZWRpdHMiOnsicmVzaXplIjp7IndpZHRoIjo0NDAsImhlaWdodCI6NDQwLCJmaXQiOiJjb3ZlciIsIndpdGhvdXRFbmxhcmdlbWVudCI6dHJ1ZX0sIndlYnAiOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6OTB9LCJqcGVnIjp7InF1YWxpdHkiOjkwfSwicm90YXRlIjpudWxsfX0=?bc=1"},"display":{"url":"https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiI2MzYvb3JpZ2luYWxfNDM1cHgtV2gtZWFydGgtNjktY292ZXIuanBnIiwiZWRpdHMiOnsicmVzaXplIjp7IndpZHRoIjoxMjAwLCJoZWlnaHQiOjEyMDAsImZpdCI6Imluc2lkZSIsIndpdGhvdXRFbmxhcmdlbWVudCI6dHJ1ZX0sIndlYnAiOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6OTB9LCJqcGVnIjp7InF1YWxpdHkiOjkwfSwicm90YXRlIjpudWxsfX0=?bc=1"},"large":{"url":"https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiI2MzYvb3JpZ2luYWxfNDM1cHgtV2gtZWFydGgtNjktY292ZXIuanBnIiwiZWRpdHMiOnsicmVzaXplIjp7IndpZHRoIjoxODAwLCJoZWlnaHQiOjE4MDAsImZpdCI6Imluc2lkZSIsIndpdGhvdXRFbmxhcmdlbWVudCI6dHJ1ZX0sIndlYnAiOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6OTB9LCJqcGVnIjp7InF1YWxpdHkiOjkwfSwicm90YXRlIjpudWxsfX0=?bc=1"},"original":{"url":"https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/636/original_435px-Wh-earth-69-cover.jpg?1311698100?bc=1","file_size":24860,"file_size_display":"24.3 KB"}},"embed":null,"attachment":null,"metadata":null,"id":636,"base_class":"Block","class":"Image","user":{"created_at":"2011-06-21T01:41:32.080Z","slug":"charles-broskoski","username":"Charles Broskoski","first_name":"Charles","last_name":"Broskoski","full_name":"Charles Broskoski","avatar":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/15/small_f91bdac52d14ef988c9818884d6865db.jpg?1616377630","avatar_image":{"thumb":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/15/small_f91bdac52d14ef988c9818884d6865db.jpg?1616377630","display":"https://arena-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/15/medium_f91bdac52d14ef988c9818884d6865db.jpg?1616377630"},"channel_count":1543,"following_count":9022,"profile_id":111,"follower_count":3524,"initials":"CB","can_index":true,"metadata":{"description":null},"is_premium":true,"is_lifetime_premium":false,"is_supporter":true,"is_exceeding_connections_limit":false,"is_confirmed":true,"is_pending_reconfirmation":false,"is_pending_confirmation":false,"badge":"supporter","id":15,"base_class":"User","class":"User"},"position":5,"selected":true,"connection_id":1110,"connected_at":"2011-08-12T17:55:03.619Z","connected_by_user_id":15,"connected_by_username":"Charles Broskoski","connected_by_user_slug":"charles-broskoski"},{"title":"\"I want now to be the Golden Age\"","updated_at":"2022-12-08T04:04:38.483Z","created_at":"2011-10-06T17:20:52.300Z","state":"available","comment_count":1,"generated_title":"\"I want now to be the Golden Age\"","content_html":"<p>“I believe that we, that this planet, hasn't seen its Golden Age.
